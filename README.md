# Smart Mobile Application for Outfit Management and Recommendations

This bachelor’s thesis aims to develop a mobile application designed for the virtual management
of personal wardrobes, with the goal of facilitating the process of organizing and
selecting daily outfits. It is developed using the `Python` language and the `React Native`
framework.

The application offers personalized outfit recommendations, tailored to current weather
conditions and user preferences through the use of an algorithm based on Bayes’ theorem.
Additionally, the characteristics of clothes are automatically extracted from photos uploaded
by users, thus simplifying the process of adding them to the virtual wardrobe. 

The application allows for the configuration and planning of outfits in a calendar, creating an
overview and better organization of the wardrobe. Furthermore, the application provides
an AI-based opinion to help the user assess the suitability of outfits with a particular
fashion style.

Moreover, the application allows users to sell clothes from their own wardrobe and
buy clothes from other users’ wardrobes, with product recommendations based on visual,
textual, and categorical similarities. When adding a garment from the wardrobe
to the virtual store, the description is automatically generated based on the image and
information about it.

The application also generates a series of statistics that provide information about
wardrobe usage, identifying the most and least used items from the current season, color
preferences for the current month, the distribution of clothes according to weather type,
and more.
